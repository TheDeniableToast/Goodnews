                <p>This group of teenagers saved their town from going bankrupt.</p>
                <p>The town of Tremont has a history of financial issues dating all the way back to the 1930s.</p>
                <p>However, when six teenagers heard that the town had to demolish a block of apartments due to not
                    being able to afford them anymore, they wanted to stop it.</p>
                <p>Over the course of three months, the teens did everything they could to save money for the town. They
                    set up a kickstarter for the prevention of the apartments demolition.</p>
                <p>The kickstarter went viral and the teenagers were overwhelmed by the amount of donations and support
                    that they were getting. They ended up making more than twice the money that they had set the goal
                    for.</p>
                <p>The teenagers gave all the money to the town. The demolition was later cancelled and the town is now
                    doing better than ever before.</p>
